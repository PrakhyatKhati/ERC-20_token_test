# Sample Hardhat Project

ERC-20.
@Openzeppline contracts are being used. 
--we will have a cap supply for creating a value. 
-- but here the token as to be generated, and how will we generate a mining reward.
-- should we want the token to burn the token?
--

Letâ€™s try this!!
 Max supply: - 100, 000, 000. 
--

Initial supply (sent to owner): - 70,00,000.
Here the remain 30,00,000 will be allocated to the reward wining system.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

HERE WE CAN SEE THE CONTRACT OF THE TOKEN IN THE TEST NETWROK. 
SIMILARLY, the contracthas the coin loaded in the metamask wallet.<img width="360" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-23 at 4 39 55 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90866319/192065789-3f154cb5-4832-44ac-b199-5586589a542a.png">
